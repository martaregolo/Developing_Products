## Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This is an app that allows users to predict the number of people employed based on different variables that users can choose. 

You can go to: https://regolomarta.shinyapps.io/prediction_model/, choose what variable use for your prediction between:
* GNP.deflator, the GNP implicit price deflator;
* GNP, the Gross National Product;
* Armed.Forces, the number of people in the armed forces;
* Population, the 'noninstitutionalized' population >= 14 years of age;
* Year, the year (time)

and choose at which value you want to evaluate the predicted number of people employed.

Here a fancy presentation! https://rpubs.com/martaregolo/PitchPresentation
